#Phases
*Research / Planning: In Progress 6/8/2025
  For this project I need to fully understand API's, my Arduino circuit, and improve my understanding of cryptocurrency.
  I will begin looking for API's that meet my needs, and choosing components for the circuit.
  
*Basic implementation: Not started
  Basic implementation would mean having a rough draft of code needed for basic versions of the core features.
  A working circuit.
*Feature development: Not started
  Add more advanced features to both the code and circuit.
*Testing & debugging: Not started
  Ensure all code works smoothly and test all edgecases.
*Refactoring / scaling: Not started
