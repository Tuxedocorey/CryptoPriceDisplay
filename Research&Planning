#Phase 1 Research and planning
OK so I have found an API that I believe suits my needs, it's on https://coinmarketcap.com/api/
I am going to their Quotes Latest v2 API because it can display the most updated crypto prices.

                                ***Notes***
Right now I am currently trying to figure out how to use this API in code,
to do this I will write a simple program that calculates the price of Bitcoin.
